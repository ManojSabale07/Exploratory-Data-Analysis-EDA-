Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Real-World Data Projects

This repository contains a collection of exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects performed on four real-world datasets across diverse domains. Each project demonstrates end-to-end analytical workflow, including data cleaning, preprocessing, feature exploration, visualization, and insight extraction using Python’s data science stack.

What’s Included

HR Analytics EDA
Analyzed employee attrition patterns across 50+ features, identifying drivers related to job role, overtime, satisfaction scores, and work-life balance.

Google Play Store EDA
Explored app performance metrics (ratings, installs, pricing, categories) on 10k+ records; uncovered factors influencing app visibility and user engagement.

Chronic Disease Dataset EDA
Investigated risk factors and demographic distributions in a healthcare dataset; performed correlation studies to support predictive modeling.

[Dataset 4 Name] EDA
(You can insert your 4th dataset here — I will write a description if you tell me the dataset name.)

Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Handling missing values & outliers

Statistical exploration (distributions, correlations, group analysis)

Insight-driven visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Feature understanding for downstream ML tasks

Domain-specific pattern detection (HR, healthcare, mobile apps, etc.)

Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebooks

Project Purpose

This repository showcases real-world EDA capabilities and serves as a practical portfolio demonstrating:

Ability to work with diverse domains

Skill in drawing meaningful insights from raw datasets

Proficiency in Python data analysis workflows

Understanding of the exploratory phase before model development

Ideal for internships, data analyst roles, machine learning roles, and academic evaluations.
